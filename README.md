 Design Engineering Project 2 - FadeCandy 

1. Download Zip File (M00704717)
2. Unzip the file
3. Open the M00704717 file
4. Make sure Animation_1, Animation_2, Animation_3, Animation_4, Animation_5 and Animation_6 is present in the folder to ensure that the Final code will run.
6. If you are running in Linux or any other OS then open simulator folder and choose bin folder.
7. Once bin folder is chosen, there are other options to run the simulation on such as Linus, windows64 etc. 
8. An installation is needed and it is JAVA. Link to download JAVA: https://www.java.com/download/ie_manual.jsp
9. Once you have done that run the readopcForStrands simulator to be able to run any of the animations.
10. Make sure the opc python file is present on the folder. This will allow the readopcForStrands to work.
11. Then go back to the main folder (M00704717) and open Final pyhton code or the CompilationOfAnimation and run
12. If you would like to see the code, right-click on the mouse and edit on IDLE. Same goes for the Animation files named Animation_1, Animation_2 etc. 
13. The code in the folder (M00704717) is only compatible with Python 3.0 and above.
14. A window would pop up displaying a menu where you are able to choose the Animations you wish to see.
15. Press any of the button you wish to view
16. Once button is pressed the animation will show in the readopcForStrands simulator
17. You will only be able to run another animation once the execution of the current animation is completed. 
18. For Animation_2, there will be a message window that will ask the user a question. Click either yes or no button. 
19. For Animation_5, there will be an input on the Python Shell to fully activate the animation. Answer questions to see the animation.
20. For Animation_6, is a game where the user will need to choose from a list given to them. They will need to input the choice and animation will run. Once animation is sompleted, another question will be asked. To stop the animation, answer no.
21. To end the overall simulation, press the exit button on the top right hand side of the window
